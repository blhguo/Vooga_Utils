Select=Select Image
Intro=Welcome to Voogle Images! This is a utility that allows a user to choose from an unlimited number of images for their game objects, rather then being limited to default choices or having to add them manually to the Java project.
Menu=If you click on the "Select Image" button and download an image, it will appear inside this pane, just as it might appear in a sprite menu within your application.
Support=Voogle Images supports a wide variety of formats, including .jpg, .tif, .png, and .gif. Knock yourself out downloading!
